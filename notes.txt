goal:
Create a C++ library that can be used for accessing an NTLM protected webpage.
The main purpose of this project is to be educational.

todo:
- reconsider the "\nname"... style 
- replace msgtype with msg_type
- consider moving security_buffer into separate header file
- consider using use "at" instead of "i" as loop variable
- replace pwdhash with password_hash
- usage of pal.hpp sucks, improve it somehow
- write a clean posix based democlient
- make calculate nt response look as good as calculate_lm_response()
- clean up on reinterpret_cast
- do proper size calculation of b64str in as_base64_encoded_string()
- rename NTLM_PWDHASH_LEN with NTLM_PWDHASH_SIZE
- get rid of #define of constants
- do not convert challenge into uint64 and back into std::vector<uint8_t>
- enable command-line options to democlient
- make democlient read both unprotected stuff (eg public.txt) and protected stuff
- fix unit test for Test3_message
- proper error checking in T3 marshalling
